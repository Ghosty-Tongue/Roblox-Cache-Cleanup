# Roblox Cache Cleanup

This Python script automates the cleanup of temporary cache files generated by the Roblox platform. Over time, these cache files can accumulate and occupy valuable disk space. With this script, you can easily remove these unnecessary files, freeing up storage space on your system.

## Features

- Recursively scans the specified directory to locate all Roblox cache files.
- Calculates the total size of the cache directory and presents it in a human-readable format.
- Automatically deletes all cache files within the directory and its subdirectories without requiring user input.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script (`cleanup.py`).
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python cleanup.py
   ```
6. The script will automatically clean the specified directory (`AppData\Local\Temp\Roblox`) without requiring user input.

**Note:** This script permanently deletes files from the specified directory. Ensure you have backed up any essential data before running the script.
